## Overview

The script `library_analyzer.py` in the [JacquesGariepy/library-analyzer](https://github.com/JacquesGariepy/library-analyzer) repository is designed to analyze Python libraries and extract detailed information about their elements, such as classes, methods, functions, properties, and more. The analysis results can be saved to a JSON file for further inspection.

### Capabilities of the Code:
- **Analyze Python Libraries**: The script can analyze Python libraries and extract detailed information about various elements within the library.
- **Element Types Identified**: It identifies and categorizes elements such as classes, methods, functions, properties, modules, variables, enums, constants, dataclasses, coroutines, generators, descriptors, exceptions, and protocols.
- **Extract Type Information**: The script can safely evaluate and extract type information for various elements.
- **Extract Signatures**: It can extract function/method signatures and other relevant details such as docstrings, parameter types, and return types.
- **Class Analysis**: The script provides detailed information about classes, including base classes, methods, properties, and type hints.
- **Dataclass and Enum Analysis**: It can analyze dataclasses and enums, extracting field types and enum values.
- **Save Analysis Results**: The analysis results can be saved to a JSON file for further inspection and documentation.
- **Error Handling**: The script includes error handling to capture and log errors encountered during the analysis process.

This script is part of a larger ongoing project aimed at creating a comprehensive tool for analyzing and documenting Python libraries. The project aims to provide insights into the structure and content of libraries, aiding developers in understanding and utilizing various libraries efficiently.

## Classes

### `ElementType`

An enumeration that defines various types of elements that can be found in a library, such as classes, methods, functions, properties, modules, variables, enums, constants, dataclasses, coroutines, generators, descriptors, exceptions, and protocols.

### `LibraryAnalyzer`

The main class responsible for analyzing a library. It provides methods to analyze individual elements, extract type information, and save the analysis results.

#### Methods
    Attributes:
        explored (set): A set to keep track of explored elements to avoid redundant analysis.
        errors (list): A list to store error messages encountered during analysis.
        current_path (list): A list to maintain the current path of elements being analyzed.
        library_elements (dict): A dictionary to store information about analyzed library elements.
        type_namespace (dict): A dictionary to store type information for safe evaluation.
    Methods:
        __init__(): Initializes the LibraryAnalyzer instance and sets up the type environment.
        _setup_type_environment(): Configures the environment for type management.
        safe_eval(type_str: str): Safely evaluates a type string.
        get_type_info(typ) -> str: Converts a type to a string representation safely.
        get_signature_info(obj) -> Dict: Extracts signature information from a function/method.
        get_class_info(obj) -> Dict: Extracts detailed information from a class.
        analyze_element(obj, name: str, module_name: str) -> Dict: Analyzes an individual library element.
        get_element_type(obj) -> ElementType: Determines the precise type of an element.
        analyze_library(library_name: str) -> Dict: Performs a complete analysis of a library.
        save_analysis(analysis: Dict, output_file: str): Saves the analysis to a JSON file.

## Functions

### `analyze_and_display(library_name: str, save_to_file: bool = True)`

The main function to analyze a library and display the results. It creates an instance of `LibraryAnalyzer`, performs the analysis, and optionally saves the results to a file.

## Usage

To use the script, run it from the command line with the name of the library to analyze:

```sh
python library_analyzer.py <library_name>
python library_analyzer.py <json>

python library_analyzer.py mistralai
python library_analyzer.py C:\metrics\mistralai_analysis_v1.2.3.json
```

### Example
Here is an example of how to use the LibraryAnalyzer class to analyze a specific class from the openai library:

## Error Handling
The script includes error handling to capture and log errors that occur during the analysis process. Errors are stored in the errors attribute of the LibraryAnalyzer instance and included in the analysis results.

## Output
The analysis results include metadata about the library, such as its name, version, file location, and documentation, as well as detailed information about each element in the library. The results can be saved to a JSON file for further inspection. The filename includes the library version and increments if the file already exists. Look for files like `openai_analysis_v1.0.json` or `openai_analysis_v1.0_1.json` for the analysis results of the openai library.

## Conclusion
The library_analyzer.py script is a powerful tool for analyzing Python libraries and extracting detailed information about their elements. It can be used to gain insights into the structure and contents of a library, making it easier to understand and work with.
